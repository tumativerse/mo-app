# Mo Fitness App — MVP Specification

## Problem Statement

I want to build muscle and reduce body fat (currently 165 lbs, 25% BF) through consistent strength training. Existing apps are either too complex, clunky to use mid-workout, or lock useful features behind paywalls. I need something simple that helps me follow a program, log quickly, and see progress.

## Target User

Me. For the next 3 months minimum.

## Goal

Build a minimal fitness app that I actually use every workout.

### PPL Template Design
The PPL (Push/Pull/Legs) system uses **movement pattern slots** instead of fixed exercises:

| Day | Slots | Example Exercises |
|-----|-------|-------------------|
| **Push A** | Horizontal Push (primary), Vertical Push, Triceps, Side Delts | Bench Press, OHP, Tricep Pushdowns, Lateral Raises |
| **Push B** | Incline Push (primary), Vertical Push, Triceps, Chest Fly | Incline DB Press, Arnold Press, Skull Crushers, Cable Fly |
| **Pull A** | Vertical Pull (primary), Horizontal Pull, Biceps, Rear Delts | Pull-ups, Barbell Rows, Curls, Face Pulls |
| **Pull B** | Horizontal Pull (primary), Vertical Pull, Biceps, Rear Delts | Cable Rows, Lat Pulldowns, Hammer Curls, Reverse Fly |
| **Legs A** | Squat (primary), Hinge, Leg Curl, Calves | Squats, RDL, Leg Curls, Calf Raises |
| **Legs B** | Hinge (primary), Squat, Leg Extension, Calves | Deadlifts, Leg Press, Leg Extensions, Calf Raises |

**Key Features:**
- Exercises are suggested based on movement pattern, equipment, and user history
- Users can swap exercises within the same movement pattern
- RPE targets and rep ranges defined per slot
- Warmup templates specific to each day type

---

### Phase 4: Frontend Components ✅

#### Workout Page (`/app/(app)/workout/page.tsx`)

**Mode A: Day Overview (Before Workout)**
- Shows all exercises/slots for the day
- Movement pattern badges (primary/secondary/accessory)
- Target muscles and estimated duration
- Warmup section (collapsible) showing all phases
- Swap exercise button per slot
- "Start Workout" button

**Mode B: Focused Exercise View (During Workout)**

- Large set logging grid:
  ```
  Set 1: [weight] × [reps] @ RPE [selector]  ✓
  Set 2: [weight] × [reps] @ RPE [selector]
  + Add Set
  ```

- Soreness level (1-5 buttons)
- Quick submit

**Full Mode**
- Sleep duration (hours input)
- Sleep quality (1-5: Poor → Great)
- Energy level (1-5: Low → High)

**Fatigue Score Gauge**
- Score 0-7 with visual gauge
- Status levels: normal (green), monitor (yellow), deload (red)
- Message and recommended action

**Quick Stats**
- Sessions count (in selected period)
- Average session RPE

**Recovery Averages**
- Average sleep hours

#### Phase 4 Files Summary

| File | Lines | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `/app/(app)/workout/page.tsx` | ~1,270 | PPL workout page with two-mode design |
| `/components/recovery-checkin.tsx` | ~180 | Recovery check-in component |
| `/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` | ~290 | Updated dashboard with recovery |
| `/app/(app)/progress/page.tsx` | ~280 | Progression analytics page |

---

### Phase 5: Logic & Auto-Regulation ✅

#### Database Schema Additions
- `fatigue_logs` table - Daily fatigue snapshots with component scores
- `deload_periods` table - Track deload weeks and triggers
- `deload_type` enum - volume, intensity, full_rest
- `fatigue_level` enum - fresh, normal, elevated, high, critical

#### Training Logic Library (`/lib/training-logic/`)

**Fatigue Calculation** (`fatigue.ts`)
- 0-10 scale fatigue score based on multiple factors:
  - RPE creep (0-2 points): Are workouts getting harder?
  - Performance drop (0-2 points): High average RPE?
  - Recovery debt (0-3 points): Sleep, energy, soreness metrics
  - Volume load (0-2 points): Volume spike vs baseline
  - Training streak (0-1 point): Consecutive training days
- Status levels: fresh (0-2), normal (3-4), elevated (5-6), high (7-8), critical (9-10)
- Auto-logs to database for trend tracking

**Progression Gates** (`progression.ts`)
- Checks multiple gates before allowing weight progression:
  1. Fatigue score (blocks if ≥7)
  2. Recent performance (hit target reps?)
  3. Average RPE (under threshold?)
  4. Recovery metrics (adequate sleep/energy?)
- Different rules for compound vs isolation exercises
- Plateau detection (4+ sessions at same weight)
- Plateau-breaking strategies

**Deload Detection** (`deload.ts`)
- Auto-triggers deload based on:
  - Scheduled (every 4 weeks)
  - Sustained critical fatigue (2+ days at score ≥8)
  - Prolonged elevated fatigue (5+ days at score ≥6)
  - High fatigue + poor recovery combo
- Deload types:
  - Volume: 60% sets, 100% weight
  - Intensity: 70% sets, 85% weight
  - Full rest: Complete rest days
- Applies modifiers to workout suggestions

**Weight Suggestions** (`suggestions.ts`)
- Suggests weight based on:
  - User's last performance on exercise
  - Current fatigue level
  - Active deload modifiers
  - Progression readiness
- Warmup set progression (50% → 70% → 85%)
- Rest timer configuration by slot type and RPE

#### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/ppl/today` | GET | Enhanced with fatigue, deload, modifiers |
| `/api/progression` | GET | Uses training-logic for enhanced analysis |
| `/api/training/status` | GET | Current fatigue score, deload status |
| `/api/training/status` | POST | Trigger/end deload manually |
| `/api/training/suggest` | GET | Weight suggestions for exercise |
| `/api/training/suggest` | POST | Get suggestion after completing set |

#### Frontend Updates

**Dashboard** (`/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Fatigue indicator card with score and level
- Deload active/recommended banners
- Color-coded status (green/yellow/orange/red)

**Workout Page** (`/app/(app)/workout/page.tsx`)
- Fatigue warning banner when score ≥6
- Deload week indicator with days remaining
- Rotation message for breaks ("Ease back in", "Starting fresh")
- Volume modifier display during deload

#### Phase 5 Files Summary

| File | Lines | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `/lib/training-logic/fatigue.ts` | ~230 | Fatigue calculation & status |
| `/lib/training-logic/progression.ts` | ~280 | Progression gates & recommendations |
