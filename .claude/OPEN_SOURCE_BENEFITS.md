## 🛡️ What Stays Protected

Even though the code is public, these remain **completely private**:

### Infrastructure Access:

- ✅ Vercel deployment dashboard (only you can deploy)
- ✅ Database (Neon) - credentials in .env.local (not tracked)
- ✅ Clerk authentication - API keys in .env.local
- ✅ Stripe payments - API keys in .env.local
- ✅ GitHub repository secrets (for Actions)
- ✅ Production environment variables

### User Data:

- ✅ All user data in database (encrypted)
- ✅ Personal information (encrypted with your key)
- ✅ Workout history
- ✅ Progress metrics
- ✅ Account credentials

### Business Assets:

- ✅ Your domain name (if registered)
- ✅ Your brand/marketing
- ✅ Your user base

- ✅ Your monetization strategy

**Bottom line:** Public code ≠ Public access to your app or data!
